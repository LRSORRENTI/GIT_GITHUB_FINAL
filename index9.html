<h2>
    GitHub repo visibility: Public vs Private
</h2>

<h3>
    On GitHub we can make the visibility of any repo public or private,
    when we create a repo, GitHub will prompt you to make it public or 
    private.

</h3>

<h2>
    Adding GitHub collaborators
</h2>

<h3>
    When we add collaborators, we allow others to be able to push 
    changes to the given repo, when a repo is public, anyone can take 
    the repo and clone them, make changes/commits, but they can't 
    push those changes back up to GitHub
</h3>
<h3>
    To add a collaborator, inside of our repo settings, we can go to 
    the 'manage access' tab, and add direct access collaborators, we 
    then enter the persons GitHub user name/ email, then all that 
    person needs to do is accept the invite and voila, collaboration
    is now enabled between you and that person
</h3>
<h2>
    The GitHub collaboration demo
</h2>
<h3>
    Okay in colt's demo he's showing two users collaborating on a 
    project, first user is Colt, second user is Stevie,
    Colt initializes the repo, adds some text to the file, 
    then pushes the file to GitHub
</h3>
<h3>
    Then Stevie clones the repo, sees the text inside the file, adds 
    some extra text to the file, then pushes back to GitHub

</h3>
<h3>
    Now Colt can see stevie pushed some work to GitHub, there are 2 commits 
    now, so Colt can use git pull, or git fetch, to bring those changes down 
    to his machine
</h3>
<h3>
    That's the basic GitHub collaboration workflow, you and your teammates ,
    make changes, push them to GitHub, then you can bring those changes 
    to your machine with git pull or git fetch
</h3>

<h2>What are READMEs and why they're important</h2>
<h3>
    A README file is used to communicate important information about 
    a given repository including:
</h3>
<h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            What the project does
        </li>
        <li>
            How to run the project
        </li>
        <li>
            Why it's noteworthy
        </li>
        <li>
            Who maintains the project
        </li>
    </ul>
</h3>
<h3>
    READMEs play an important role, it's often the first 
    thing someone looks at when they're viewing your project, and if you put 
    the README.md in the root of your directory, GitHub 
    will display it automatically
</h3>
<h3>
    For reference the .md stands for 'markdown', markdwon files are 
    convenient syntax to generate formatted text, and it's easy to use
</h3>

<h3>
    Markdown itself is a 'text to HTML' conversion tool for web writers,
    markdown allows you to write and easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain 
    text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML or HTML
</h3>

<h3>
    Markdown is not specific to GitHub, people use markdown all over 
    the place, there are tools to write and render markdown yourself, 
    VSCode extensions, standalone applications
</h3>
<h3>
    Check this link for full guide to markdown: https://markdown-it.GitHub.io/
</h3>
<h3>
    So just like HTML there are headings: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6,
</h3>
<h3>
    For an h1 we write the markup with a '#' followed by space, then our text,
     for h2 it's two '#' , for an h3  it's 3 '#' and so on
</h3>
<h3>
    Okay so now I'm going to create a README for this file
</h2>
<h3>
    Okay just created a basic README file, added and pushed it to 
    GitHub, added the link from above there as well, it's a great 
    guide to creating visually appealing README files

</h3>

<h2>GitHub Gists</h2>
<h3>
    GitHub gists are a simple way to share code snippets and 
    useful fragments with others. Gists are much easier to create 
    but offer far fewer features than a typical GitHub repository
</h3>
<h3>
    All we need to do is use .html, .js, or .md and the gist will 
    show it as a HTML file, JS file or README.md file
</h3>
<h2>
    GitHub Pages
</h2>
<h3>
    What are GitHub pages? GH pages are public webpages that are 
    hosted and published via GitHub, they allow us to create a website 
    by simply pushing your code to GitHub
</h3>

<h3>
    So we can easily host webpages on GitHub, there are restrictions, 
    it DOES NOT support server-side code like Python, Ruby, or Node.
    Just HTML/CSS/JS! Static webpages only. It's free and it's built into 
    GitHub itself
</h3>
<h3>
    There are two types of GitHub pages:
</h3>
<h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            User Site
        </li>
        <h3>
            You get one user site per GitHub account, this is where 
            you could host a portfolio site or some form of personal 
            website, the default url is based on your GitHub username,
            following this pattern: username.github.io, though you 
            can change this
        </h3>
        <li>
            Project sites
        </li>
        <h3>
            You get unlimited project sites! Each GitHub repo 
            can have a corresponding hosted website. It's as simple 
            as telling GitHub which specific branch contains the 
            web content. The default urls follow this pattern: 
            username.github.io/repo-name
        </h3>
    </ul>
</h3>

<h3>
    Now let's demonstrate how to create a GitHub page, 
    from your project, go to settings, navigate down to pages, 
    select build and deply from whichever branch you want to display, then 
    after a minute or two it loads and it will display: 'Your site is 
    live at username.github.io/projectname'
</h3>
<h3>
    Github has great documentation to getting everything set up, 
    so for future reference looking at their documentation will 
    help set up your github hosted static webpage
