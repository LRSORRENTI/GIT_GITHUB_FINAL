        branch etc.. those are the bread and butter.

    <h2>
        Intro to Git Diff
    </h2>
    <h3> We use the git diff command to view changes between 
        branches, commmits, files, directories and more! 
        We often use git diff alongside git status and git log, to 
        understand and get a better picture of a repository, and 
        how it's changed over time.
    </h3>
    <h3>Git diff is purely an informative command, it's about 
        understanding changes, and how they have changed.
    </h3>
    <h3>What's the output of git diff and what does it mean? </h3>
    <h3>Well git diff always follows a very similar pattern,
        it shows the changes made since the last commit, it's usually 
        highlighted in green with a '+' or '-' sign in git bash.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Now lets look at git diff HEAD
    </h3>
    <h3>
        so git diff HEAD, so we may see the same changes as git diff, but 
        this changes when we add a file to the staging area, once we add 
        the file with git add, when we input git diff, it'll show nothing 
        because the file's been added to the staging area
    </h3>
    <h3>But if we input git diff HEAD it will show the changes even 
        though our file has been added to the staging area
    </h3>
    <h3>
        So the takeaway here is that git diff shows the staged changes, and 
        git diff HEAD shows all changes, staged and unstaged.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Another way we can use git diff is with: git diff --staged and 
        git diff --cached, they do the exact same thing --staged is an 
        alias of --cached, but they show 'Show me what will be 
        included in my current commit'
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        We can also narrow down git diff with the command git diff [filename]
        If there's a specific file you want to see changes is you can 
        input the command like this: git diff HEAD style/main.css
    </h3>
    <h3>
        This will show the changes made inside the main.css file
    </h3>
    
    <h2>Comparing changes between branches</h2>
    <h3>We can also use git diff to compare changes 
        between specified branches, the command looks like:
        git diff branch1..branch2
    </h3>
    <h2>
        The last comparison we'll look at is using git diff 
        to compare commits. To compare two commits the command 
        looks like: git diff commithashone..commithashtwo
    </h2>
    <h3>
        So in essence to compare two commits, we need to copy 
        the hash of a given commit, and the hash of the other commit 
        and add them to our git diff commithashone..commithashtwo
        command
    </h3>
    <h2>Using a GUI to visualize git diff</h2>
    <h3>
        Using a GUI like GitKraken to visualize Git Diff, definitely very 
        useful when working with large files
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Okay I just finished colt's git diff exercise, went well, I forgot 
        about the git diff --cached command, but got through the exercise 
        without trouble.
    </h3>
    <h2>Intro to Git Stash command</h2>
    <h3>Some people don't use git stash frequently, but it's helpful 
        to learn about git stash, but you may not use it all the time.
    </h3>
    <h3>Important:
        <ul>
            <li>Git stash basics</li>
            <li>Git stash save</li>
            <li>Git stash pop</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Nice to have but not vital:</h3>
         <ul><h3>
    <li>Git stash apply</li>
    <li>Dropping an clearing the stash</li>
         </ul>
         </h3>
    </h3>
    <h2>Why is git stashing a thing? What does it solve?</h2>
    <h3>
        Git stash is useful when you don't want to make a full commit, 
        but you need to go somewhere else, change branches, coworker asks 
        for help etc.. 
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Git provides an easy way to stash uncommitted changes so we can return 
        to them later without having to make unnecessary commits
    </h3>
    <h3>
        The command itself is: git stash, and this will take all uncommitted 
        changes and stashes them. In the event we don't want to commit but 
        we also don't want to lose anything, we use git stash, then we can 
        move to whichever branch we need because our changes are stashed
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Then once we want to reinstate our stashed changes we use the command 
        git stash pop
    </h3>
    
    <h2>
        Git stash apply command
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Git stash and git stash pop are the most common stash commands 
        but git stash apply is another command we can use
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Git stash apply behaves similarly to git stash pop, except with apply, 
        the changes are simultaneously inside the stash and applied, where 
        as git stash pop clears the stash, git stash apply applies the changes 
        but still has the stashed data inside the stash
    </h3>
    
    <h3> 
        It's important to know we can stash multiple times, with multiple
        changes. We can view our stash list with the command: git stash list
    </h3>
    
    <h3> We can also use a specific stash based on it's unique id, 
        which looks like: git stash apply stash@{2} 
    </h3>
    <h3>
        We can also drop stashes with the command git stash drop stash@{2}
        we can drop particular entries within our stash with this command:
        $ git stash drop stash@{0}
    Dropped stash@{0} (a95a8d099dd503aacb5f9e700acc151b132dc1d8)
    
    </h3>
    <h3>
        We can also use the commmand git stash clear, to clear out all 
        stashed items
    </h3>
    <h2>
        Git stash exercise
    </h2>
    <h3>
        # Stashing Exercise
    
    1. Initialize a new git repo in a folder
    2. Create a file called `diary.txt`.  Inside the file, add the following:
        
        ```
        I love my boss
        ```
        
    3. Add and commit the changes on the `master` branch
    4. Create a new branch called `the-truth`.  Switch to it.
    5. In the `diary.txt` file, erase the contents and instead replace it with:
        
        ```
        I HATE MY BOSS
        I HATE MY BOSS
        I HATE MY BOSS
        I HATE MY BOSS
        I HATE MY BOSS
        ```
        
    6. Save the file
    7. **OH NO!** Your boss is walking towards you! Quick, switch over to the `master` branch!
    8. **WHATTT?** The `diary.txt` file still contains our confession?  **Quick, stash the changes before your boss sees!!**
    9. Your `diary.txt` file should now only contain "I love my boss"
    10. As your boss walks by, add more lies to the `diary.txt` file:
        
        ```
        I love my boss
        I love my boss
        I love my boss
        ```
        
    11. Add and commit your changes on the `master` branch.
    12. Now that your boss has left, it's safe to get back to the truth! Switch over to the `the-truth` branch.
    13. Retrieve the earlier changes that you stashed (I HATE MY BOSS x 5)
    14. Add and commit the changes on the `the-truth` branch
    </h3>
    
    <h2>====================================== ======================</h2>
    <h2>KEEPING FILES LOCAL TO EACH BRANCH, WE MUST ADD AND COMMIT</h2>
    <h2>=============================================================</h2>
    <h3>Note to self, if we create a branch off of main/master, master has one file: index.html,
        let's say we create a branch called test ,
        then we switch to test and inside of test we create a new file; test.txt,
         if we switch back to main/master, that 
        file comes with us, and if we ls it will show 
        both index.html and test.txt, 
         If we want to leave the file on the test branch, and keep it separate from 
         main/master we must commit the changes to the test branch first, then 
         switch to master/main. I wanted to create this note because I kept 
         wondering why these branch specific files were moving across branches,
         it's because the added files must be added and committed to the 
         branch they are on before switching branches, otherwise they'll 
         come along for the ride
