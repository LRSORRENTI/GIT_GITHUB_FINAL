    <h2>GIT TAGS: Marking important moments in history</h2>

    <h3>
      Now git tags themselves aren't used all the time, it depends on the
      project/company you're working with, or just your personal habits
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Most often these days tags are used to mark different releases or versions
      of a given project like: version 2.0 or version 3.2 etc..
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Important:
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding git tags</li>
        <li>Viewing tags</li>
        <li>Lightweight vs Annotated tags</li>
        <li>Pushing tags</li>
      </ul>
      Nice to have:
      <ul>
        <li>Semantic versioning</li>
        <li>Moving tags</li>
        <li>Deleting tags</li>
        <li>Diffing tags</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>

    <h3>The idea behind Git Tags</h3>
    <h3>
      Tags are pointers that refer to particular points in Git history, we can
      mark a particular moment with a git tag. Tags are most often used to mark
      version releases in projects: (v4.1.0 or v4.1.1 etc..)
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Think of tags as branch references that don't change, once a tag is
      created, it always refers to the same commit, it's just a label for a
      commit
    </h3>

    <h3>
      The two types of tags:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lightweight tags: these tags are... lightweight, they're just a
          name/label that points to a specific commit
        </li>
        <li>
          Annotated tags: these tags store extra meta-data including the
          author's name, current date, email, and a tagging message. Similar to
          a commit message
        </li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h3>But first let's go over 'versioning'</h3>
    <h3>
      Semantic versioning spec outlines a standardized versioning system for
      software releases, it provides a consistent way for developers to give
      meaning to their software releases (how big of a change is this release??)
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Versions always consist of 3 numbers separated by periods, version 1.0.0
      or version 1.3.0, version 2.4.1 etc...
    </h3>
    <h3>
      2.4.1 The first number in the sequence denotes major releases (2), The
      second number denotes minor releases(4) and the last number denotes patch
      releases(1)
    </h3>

    <h3>
      The initial release is typically always 1.0.0, version 1.0.0 defines the
      public API, then with the first patch release it becomes version 1.0.1,
      and minor releases become 1.1.1
    </h3>
    The first number is reserved for major releases, version 1.3.5 now becomes
    2.0.0, or version 3.5.1 becomes version 4.0.0, these are significant changes
    that are no longer backwards compatible, features have been changed
    substantially or removed completely
    <h3>
      The second number denotes new features or functionality that was added to
      the project, but the project is still backwards compatible, no breaking
      changes, the new functionality is optional and should not force users to
      rewrite their own code
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The last number denotes patch releases, these typically don't contain
      significant changes, huge new features, but usually include bug fixes, and
      other changes that don't impact how the code is used
    </h3>
    <h3>
      This is very important when you may be using a certain library, or peice
      of software as a depedency for your own software you're building
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Take bootstrap for CSS, if we go to github we can view the tagged releases
      of bootstrap over time, like bootstrap version 4.5.1, then above it is
      bootstrap version 4.5.2, and each version has notes describing what's
      changed in the new version
    </h3>
    <h3>
      React has similar tags like react version 16.10.0 , react version 16.13.0,
      17.0.1
    </h3>
    <h3>That's the idea behind Semantic versioning</h3>

    <h2>Viewing and searching tags</h2>
    <h3>
      If we type: git tag, in a given repo, it will print a list of all the tags
      in the current repo
    </h3>
    <h3>
      If we clone the REACT github repo, then inside type git tag, it displays a
      long list of tags, v1.0.0 all the way to v17.0.1
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We can also search for tags that match a particular pattern using the: git
      tag -l "*beta*"(git tag + lowercase L + all tags that include 'beta' in
      their name)
    </h3>
    <h3>
      If we type git tag -1 "v17*", all the tags that begin with v17 will be
      displayed
    </h3>
    <h2>Comparing tags with git diff</h2>
    <h3>
      We can also checkout tags using git checkout tagname, to view the state of
      a repo at that tag point, this puts us in detached HEAD!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      If we type git checkout 15.3.1, we will go into detached HEAD, where we
      can do some experimenting, create a new experimental branch off of this
      specific commit , like git switch -c " BRANCH_FROM_TAG_15.3.1"
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We could diff betwwen tags to see the difference between them, like git
      diff v17.0.0 v17.0.1, which would display all the changes made in the
      v17.0.1 patch, we can even do this to compare major changes, like git diff
      v.15.0.0 v.17.0.0, this would display a huge list of differences
    </h3>
    <h2>Creating lightweight tags</h2>
    <h3>
      To create a lightweight tag, we enter: git tag tagname, this will create a
      tag referring to the commit the HEAD is referencing, like git tag v17.0.4,
      this will create the tag v17.0.4
    </h3>
    <h2>Annotated tags</h2>
    <h3>
      We can use annotated tags to create a new tag but with annotated we can
      append a message to our tag, similar to a commit message, git tag -a
      tagname, this will open vscode to ask for a message to add to the tag, we
      can also use the '-m' flag to write a message on the command line instead
      of using our editor
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Now to view the tag message, we use the command: git show tagname, so git
      show v17.0.1, this will display the message that was appended to the
      specified tag
    </h3>

    <h2>Tagging previous commits</h2>
    <h3>
      We can tag older commits with the following command: git tag tagname
      commithash, git tag v1.0.1 67e841982, on the commit that has 67e841982 as
      it's hash id, a tag is created, v1.0.1
    </h3>
    <h2>Replacing tags with git force</h2>
    <h3>
      We can use the '-f ' flag to force our tag through, git will yell at us if
      we reuse a tag that's already referring to a commit, git tag -f tagname
    </h3>
    <h3>
      This is useful if we accidentally tag the wrong commit hash, but we must
      include the '-f' otherwise git will throw 'fatal error message'
    </h3>
    <h2>Deleting tags</h2>
    <h3>We can delete tags using the command: git tag -d tagname</h3>
    <h3>So if we type git tag -d v1.0.2, that tag will be deleted</h3>

    <h2>Pushing tags (IMPORTANT)</h2>
    <h3>
      By default, the git push command doesn't transfer tags to remote servers,
      if you have many tags you want to push up at once, you need to use this
      command: git push --tags, this will transfer all your tags to the remote
      server
    </h3>

    <h3>
      Or to push a single tag the command is: git push origin tagname, git push
      origin v1.1.3, v.1.1.3 will be pushed
    </h3>
