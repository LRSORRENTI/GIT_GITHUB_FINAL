    <h3>
        Rebasing is often avoided by beginners because it can 
        really mess things up, especially if you don't 
        fully understand why/when you should rebase, and when 
        you definitely SHOULD NOT use it
    </h3>
    <h3>
        REBASING itself is an alternative to merging, and there are 
        two main ways to use the git rebase command:

        Comparing MERGING & REBASING
    </h2>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>
        Let's look at the 'problem' with rebasing, let's pretend 
        we're working on a project with 10 other developers,
        and we're all collaborating on a big codebase together
    </h3>
    <h3>
        I start to work on a new feature, so I make a new feature 
        branch,  and I do some work on that feature branch, but 
        a few hours later, one of my teammates finished the feature that 
        they were working on, and that code is merged into main, so 
        we want that work now, we usually never want to diverge from the 
        main branch for a long time without gettingthose 
        changes 
        </h3>
        <h3>
            So we then merge main into our feature and keep working,
            then we do more work, but the next day there's even more 
            new changes on main branch, so we merge again, 
            we merge master into our feature branch
        </h3>
        <h3>
            So now our feature branch has a bunch of merge commits, 
            if the main branch is very active, our feature 
            branch history is muddied
        </h3>
        <h3>
            This is something rebasing can help with
        </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            
        <h2 class="display-4">REBASING!</h2>
       
    <h3>
        We can instead rebase the feature branch onto main branch, 
        this moves the entire feature branch so that it BEGINS at 
        the tip of main branch, all the work is still there, but 
        we have re-written history
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Instead of using a merge commit, rebasing rewrites history
        by creating new commits for each of the 
        original feature branch commits
    </h3>
    <h3>
        git switch feature 
        <br>
        git rebase main
    </br>
    </h3>
    <h3>
        So when we rebase instead, we rewrite history, based upon 
        the original feature branch commits, the tree becomes 
        linear, feature branch is at the tip of main
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Another way to rebase is to wait until we're fully done with 
        our feature/code then rebase the feature onto main branch
    </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
    <h2 class="display-4">Rebasing in essence</h2>
    <div class="container">
    <h3>
        In essence rebasing is used when we want to clean 
        up merge commit history, it creates brand new commits 
        for each of our feature branch commits, no unnecessary
        merge commits, our project history is now linear
    </h3>
    <h3>
        This won't screw up the main branch itself, but 
        it will put all of our commits at the tip of the 
        main branch, 'rebasing' them at the tip
    </h3>
    <h3>
        This is demonstrated visually in GitKraken our GUI, 
        before rebasing our commit history is non-linear, after 
        using git rebase all our commits are in-line and on 
        the tip of main
    </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
    <h2 class="display-4">THE GOLDEN RULE, WHEN NOT TO REBASE</h2>
    <div class="container">
    <h3>
    Never rebase commits that have been share with others, if 
    you've already pushed commits to GitHub... DO NOT REBASE them 
    unless you're positive no one on your team is using those 
    commits
    </h3>
    <h3>
        You can rebase your feature branch, but don't rebase other branches 
        that are not yours. 
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Remember to rebase we use the git command from our feature branch, 
        so the workflow looks like this :
       
    </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <ol>
            <li>
                git switch feature
            </li>
            <li>
                git rebase main
            </li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
        <h3>
        When we use rebase we ALWAYS type the command from 
        our branch, not anyone elses/main branch, always type 
        git status, check and make sure you're on 
        your own feature branch, then type git rebase main
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Also when we rebase we can also end up with conflicts, 
        in order to resolve, we can go into our conflicted file 
        and we can manually remove them, or use VSCODE's input, 
        that asks for accept both changes, accept incoming change.. 
        etc, after we resolve them, back in the command line 
        we can type: git rebase --continue

        Cleaning up with INTERACTIVE REBASE
    </h2>
    <h3>
        With interactive rebasing, we can reword commits, edit commits, 
        'fix up and squash' commits, drop commits, but all of 
        this is nice to have, it's not extremely critical to 
        the day to day git workflow

        Sometimes we want to rewrite history, delete, rename, and

        Also remember, we don't want to rewrite others history, 
        this is more for only our work, our branches. Cleaning 
        up our history

    <h3>
        The git rebase command for interactive rebase looks like: 
        git rebase -i HEAD~4, this will enter into 'interactive mode',
        where we can edit commits, add files, drop commits etc.. 
        Note we do need to specify how far back we want to go
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Also keep in mind we're rebasing commits based on the 
        HEAD of where they are based

    <div class="container">
    
    <h2 class="display-4">Rewording commits with INTERACTIVE REBASE</h2>
    <h3>
        Running git rebase with the '-i' flag will enter the 
        interactive mode, which allows us to edit commits, add files, 
        drop commits etc.. Note, we must specify how far back to go
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Also know that we are NOT rebasing onto another 
        branch, instead we're rebasing a series of commits onto 
        the HEAD they're currently on
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        Okay so I just finished with colt's interactive rebase 
        demo, and I got it to work, my default editor wasn't set, so 
        I googled it and after running: git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
        that fixed the problem, I was then able to run: git rebase -i HEAD~9 
        and VSCODE automatically opened the visual based rebasing tool,
        easy to follow instructions, and git bash was waiting until I closed 
        the interactive rebase, then changed that specified commit message
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        As a reminder, when VSCODE opens our interactive rebase, 
        we have a few options to pick:
    </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <ul>
            <li>
                pick - use this commit
            </li>
            <li>
                reword - use this commit, but edit the commit message
            </li>
            <li>
                edit - use this commit, but stop for amending
            </li>
            <li>
                fixup - use this commit contents but meld it 
                into a previous commit and discard the commit 
                message
            </li>
            <li>
                drop - remove commit
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
    <h3>
        Let's see how we can combine commits in our 
        interactive rebase with VSCODE, to do this we can 
        use the 'fixup' command 
    </h3>
    <h3>
        So if for example we have: pick 21acd17 add bootstrap, and: 
        pick 4c6cb28 whoops forgot to add bootstrap js script, 
        if we change  pick 4c6cb28 to  fixup 4c6cb28, the 4c6cb28 will 
        disappear when we type git log --oneline, but it's still 
        there, we can still see it on github, it just melded 
        with the previous commit.
    </h3> 
    <h3>
        Seems a little confusing but the interactive rebase 
        tool through VSCODE is really nice, it shows all the 
        options and lays out how they work clearly
    </h3>
    
    
    <h3>
        We can also completely remove commits with the interactive
        rebase option: 'drop', using drop will remove the commit 
        entirely. Along with that commits contents.
