    <h2>Undoing changing and time-traveling in Git</h2>
    <h3>
      This next section is a motley crue of git commands, we'll be going over a
      few commands you may not use everyday
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Critical:
      <ul>
        <li>Checking out commits</li>
        <li>"Escaping detached HEAD"</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Important:
      <ul>
        <li>Discarding changes with checkout</li>
        <li>Git restore</li>
        <li>Git reset</li>
        <li>Git revert</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>Checking out old commits</h2>
    <h3>
      We're going to go back to git checkout, we can use git checkout to look at
      a specific commit hash with the command: git checkout + hashnumhere, git
      checkout d8194d6
    </h3>
    <h3>
      After entering the above, a message appears: "You are in a 'detached head'
      state, you can look around, make experimental changes, and commit them,
      and discard any commits you make in this state, without impacting any
      branches by switching back to a branch
    </h3>
    <h3>
      After entering git checkout 37ed289, we now only see 4 commits, versus the
      10 or so commits when we first did git log --oneline inside our repo, we
      traveled back in time.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Head usually points to the branch reference, and the branch reference
      points to the most recent commit on the branch, but when we use git
      checkout plus a hash num, we detach the head from master, and head is now
      pointing to the specified commit hash num
    </h3>

    <h2>Re-attaching our detached head</h2>
    <h3>
      So in this state we can see and examine the contents of the old commit, we
      can leave and go back to where we were and re-attach the HEAD, or we could
      create a new branch, switch to it and make/save changes because after
      creating and switching branches, our head is also now re-attached.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So we saw that we can check out a particular commit using a commit hash.
      But there's another way in get that we can reference other commits. We can
      reference things based upon head.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The syntax is kind of it's a little weird, but it looks like this head and
      then a tilde, which is usually above the tab key and then a number. So
      head tilde one is actually going to refer to whatever commit comes before.
      Head Think of it as head minus one head. Tilde two it's whatever comes to
      commits before head the grandparent commit. So if this is where head is,
      if I check out head. Tilde one It's the previous commit head. Tilde two is
      this commit three is this one so I don't use this all that often, but
      sometimes if you have a reason to reference what you did in the last
      commit and you don't want to go look up that commit hash, you can still
      very easily reference it with head tilde one So I'll show that very
      quickly on our master branch. Just take a look.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So we've got big in chapter three. That's where we are right now. If I
      just want to go back one commit, I could copy this. Right, and then check
      that out or I can do this. Get check out. Head. Tilde one not 21, just
      one.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      And once again, we're back to detach Head, because we checked out a
      particular commit. This is just a different way to reference that commit,
      right? We just said the previous commit, but it still commit. We're not on
      a branch and we see that here. Head is now pointing to this commit add
      headings to all files. So before head was pointing to master which is
      still pointing to this commit. Now head is one before and what we see in
      our file we probably won't notice a whole lot, but there's no chapter
      three. That is the difference. Chapter one and chapter two are here, but
      chapter three was the next commit. It still exists on Master, of course.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So from here, if I want to go back one commit again, I can just do the
      same command get check out head minus or tilde one because head is now
      right here. I can still reference one commit prior. And now we go back one
      one further. So there we are. Head is now here. And we can see we don't
      have those headings in my files anymore. Chapter two. Chapter one. They
      used to have a heading up top, and that's kind of all I want to show. I'll
      switch back to Master now. Get switch, master.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      And now we have those headings back and we have Chapter three back. So
      we're back up to date with the Master Branch reference. One other thing
      that we can do to get back to the branch we were on, so let me try and
      explain that in a better way. If I check out some commit, I go into
      detached head. Right now I'm on master, right? So if I check out head
      Tilde, I don't know. Let's go way back like eight. We're way back here.
      This commit here. Now, if I want to go back to where I was, I want to
      leave detached head. One option is to just remember what branch I was on.
      Master, and go back to Master. Get switch master. The other option is get
      switch with a dash and that will just take me back to whatever branch I
      was on last. And that happens to be master. But I could show a different
      example, right? We have this other branch. I already forgot the name. What
      is it? Chapter two redo. If we check that out or switch to it. Either one.
      That's where I was. Now I'm going to go back, get check out head. Let's do
      Tilde one. So I'm on this branch. I'm going to go back one commit. And now
      I just want to leave. Detached head. I don't remember what branch I was on
      or I'm just lazy. I do get switched dash and it takes me back to where I
      left off. That's all I wanted to show.
    </h3>
    <h2>Discarding changes with Git Checkout</h2>
    <h3>
      Okay so colt just made a new repo, with two files: dog.txt and cat.txt,
      first we initialized the repo, then one by one added 3 commits, all
      saying: first commit, second, and third, one line at a time
    </h3>
    <h3>
      This is to demonstrate how we could use git checkout to revert changes or
      discard changes back to an earlier version of a file
    </h3>
    <h3>We can do this with the command: git checkout HEAD file-name</h3>
    <h3>In our example it would be: git checkout HEAD dog.txt</h3>
    <h3>
      We're telling git take the contents of dog.txt at HEAD, and get rid
      of/discard the changes we made.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      And yes it works, cat.txt and dog.txt were reverted to their original
      state, the changes I made are gone
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Another way to do the same thing is with the git command: git checkout --
      cat.txt dog.txt
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So git checkout HEAD dog.txt and git checkout -- dog.txt do the exact
      same, just different ways of using the same command
    </h3>
    <h2>Intro to GIT RESTORE command</h2>
    <h3>
      This is a new command in Git, and it helps us undo operations, keep in
      mind we just saw git checkout -- filenamehere command discard changes, but
      git checkout does a ton of different things, which is why git restore was
      introduced, similar to how git switch was also added as an alternative to
      git checkout
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We use git restore to unmodify files, in case you changed and saved a
      file, but don't want those changes to stay, you can use git restore, be
      cautioned though, after entering the git restore command, there's no going
      back, the uncommitted changes are permanently gone, use git restore with
      utmost certainty you want to discard changes made.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      And yes git restore does work, after entering the command, all the changes
      I made are gone, and the file is back to the state in which I made the
      last commit
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Now remember this command has the exact same result as git checkout HEAD
      dog.txt, it's just simpler
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We could also go back further in our commit history with this command: git
      restore --source HEAD ~2 dog.txt
    </h3>
    <h3>
      the ~2 or ~num is specifying how many commits to go back, we could go back
      3 commits with ~3
    </h3>
    <h2>Second use of git restore</h2>
    <h3>
      We can also utilize git restore to remove files from the staging area, if
      you accidentally use git add on a file by mistake we use the following
      command: git restore --staged file-name
    </h3>

    <h3>
      So in summary we can use git restore filename to discard changes, and we
      use git restore --staged file-name to unstage an added fike
    </h3>
    <h2>Undoing commits with git reset command</h2>
    <h3>
      So in case we want to undo a commit, we can use git reset git-hash-num to
      undo them, be warned though, after entering the commits are gone
    </h3>
    <h2>Intro to git revert</h2>
    <h3>
      Another similar sounding command, that also will undo changes, except git
      revert hashnum, will leave a trace of the deletion, when we use git
      reset/restore, those commits are gone without any evidence of deletion,
      but git revert will leave evidence of the deletion, the history is
      preserved.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      This is useful when working on a team, using git reset causes problems
      when working with others, they may need to see the commit that was
      deleted, which is why using git revert instead is best practice
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Okay just finished the git restore/revert exercise, got through it okay,
      seems easy enough
    </h3>
