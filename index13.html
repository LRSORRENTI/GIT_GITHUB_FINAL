            The local config file
          </li>
        </ul>
        Nice to have:

            </li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>
        Working with the local config file
    </h2>
    <h3>
        We can change  things in our  config file at a 
        local level, we've seen how we can change settings in 
        our global config, like changing name and email 
        across all repos, but the local git config file 
        can be changed on a per-repo basis
    </h3>
    <h3>
        This is also where we can add git aliases, we'll go more 
        in depth on that in a bit.
    </h3>
        <h3>
        Remember we can change our username if we cd into our .git,
        folder with the: git config user.name command, but 
        we can configure it locally with this command:
        git config --local user.name "Local Luke",
        so that local repo has it's username changed from 
        Luke Sorrenti to Local Luke, we can do the same thing with 
        email
    </h3>
    <h3>
        There are hundreds of possible settings, the official 
        git documentation has a lot of different configuration 
        settings, we could seriously customize our settings
    </h3>
    <h2>
        Inside Git: The Refs Folder
    </h2>
    <h3>
        This is where you'll find a HEADS directory, refs/heads contains
        one file per branch in a repository, each file is named after 
        a branch and contains the hash of the commit at the tip 
        of the branch
    </h3>
    <h3>
        For example: refs/heads/master contains the commit hash 
        of the last commit made on the master branch
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Refs also contains a refs/tags folder which 
        contains one file for each tag in the repo
    </h3>
    
    <h2>
        Inside Git: The HEAD file
    </h2>
    <h3>
        HEAD typically references a branch pointer, but remember
        we can also go into 'detached HEAD' to checkout 
        earlier commits
    </h3>
    <h3>
        If we're on the main branch the HEAD file contains the ref:
        ref: refs/heads/main, or if we're in our note-taking branch, 
        it displays: ref: refs/heads/note-taking
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Also remember when we use git checkout, HEAD now references 
        that specific commit, main is still pointing at the tip
    </h3>
    <h2>
        Inside Git: The OBJECTS Folder
    </h2>
    <h3>
        This is really the 'core' of git, this is where the history 
        of our file is stored, this is where the backups are, 
        where the commits are, this directory contains ALL the repo 
        files
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        The files here are all compressed and encrypted, they won't 
        look like much
    </h3>
    <h3>
        But inside this folder there are four types of git objects:
    </h3>
    <h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Commits
            </li>
            <li>
                Trees
            </li>
            <li>
                Blobs
            </li>
            Annotated tags
        </ul>
    </h3>
    
    <h2>
        But first up we need to go over HASHING FUNCTIONS
    </h2>
    <h3>
        On on our git log, we can see the commit hashes, 
        they're forty digits long, hexadecimal, base 16, meaning 
        we run out of digits (0 - 9), we move on to letters (a - f), 
        then we end up with our 40 digit long hashes
    </h3>
    <h3>
        These are the output of hashing functions, they take inputs 
        of varying sizes, and outputs a 64 digit long value, 
        so it could take in the string 'I love chickens' or 'lol' and 
        return a 64 digit-long value, fixed-size outputs
    </h3>
    <h3>
        You may also hear the term 'Cryptographic Hash Functions', 
        they do the same thing except they:
    </h3>
    <h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                One-way function (which means the output should not give any info about 
                the input that was passed in) One-way functions are ifeasable to invert
            </li>
            <li>
                Small change in input yields, large change in the output
            </li>
            <li>
                Deterministic, same input yields the same output
            </li>
            <li>
                Unlikely to find 2 outputs with exact same value
            </li>
        </ol>
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        So remember if we input 'I love chickens', if that input 
        stays the same, the output will always be the same, 'lol' should 
        always yield it's own specific output, there should be no 
        variability in the output if you're input remains the exact 
        same
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        If we were to implement a password authentication system for 
        users on a website, we use a hashing function to store 
        the hashed output of a password, so if a bad-actor, hacker 
        gets into our database, they see the hashes, they shouldn't 
        be able to infer anything about the actual password
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Now this course isn't about cyber-security or cryptocurrency,
        but Git uses one of these hashing functions, the one Git uses 
        is SHA-1
    </h3>
    <h3>
        SHA-1 (which is set to change eventually) always generates 
        40-digit hexadecimal strings, and the commit hashes we've 
        seen hundreds of times already in this course are 
        the output of the hashing function SHA-1
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        There are sets of known and widely used Cryptographic 
        Hashing functions, SHA-1, MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm), ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital 
        Signature Algorithm)
    </h3>
    <h2>
        Git as a Key-Value Datastore
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Git database, git is a key-value data store, we can insert
        any kind of content into a Git repository, and Git will 
        hand us back a unique key we can later use to retrieve 
        that content, The keys we get back are SHA-1 checksums
    </h3>
    <h3>
       Now remember the four git objects: commits, trees, blobs, and 
       annotated tags, all of these are hashed using SHA-1
    </h3>
    <h3>
        To summarize git allows us to store our data, and in return 
        git gives us a 'key' to access that data, that 'key' is 
        our 40 digit SHA-1 hash
    </h3>
    
    <h2>
        Hashing with the Git Hash-Object
    </h2>
    
    <h3>
        So let's try the command: git hash-object filename
    </h3>
    <h3>
        The git hash-object command takes in some data, stores in our 
        .git/objects directory and gives us back the unique SHA-1 hash 
        that refers to that data object
    </h3>
    <h3>
        In the simplest form Git simply takes content and returns 
        the unique key that WOULD BE used to store our data, but 
        doesn't actually store anything
    </h3>
    <h3>
        echo 'hello' | git hash-object --stdin
    </h3>
    <h3>
        The --stdin option  tells git hash-objects to use the content 
        from stdin rather than a file, for example it will hash the word 
        'hello'
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        The 'echo' command repeats whatever we tell it to repeat 
        to the termindal, we pipe the output of echo to git hash-object
    </h3>
    <h3>
        If we echo "hi" | git hash-object --stdin, git gives us 
        back a 40 hexadecimal value, and everytime we hash "hi", 
        we should always get back that exact same 40 hexadecimal value that 
        corresponds with "hi", and "hello" will have a very different
        hexadecimal value than "hi"
    </h3>
    <h3>
        But if we append the -w flag to the end like this:
        echo 'hello' | git hash-object --stdin -w, 
        this tells git to actually write the object to the 
        database, after running the command the oontents 
        of our .git/objects folder will change
    </h3>
    <h3>
        And yes after inputting the command and entering: code .git, into 
        the command line, VSCODE opens with a huge directory, and that 
        commint the starts with 'ce' is inside that directory, inside 
        the objects folder
    </h3>
    
    <h2>
        Retrieving data with: git cat-file
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Now that we have data stored in our git object database, we can try 
        Retrieving that data with the git cat-file command, if we 
        append a '-p' flag to the end, git prints the content of 
        the object based on it's type: git cat-file -p object-hash
    </h3>
    <h3>
        So yes after inputting: git cat-file -p ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a
    the string 'hello' is printed inside of git bash
    </h3>
    <h3>
        So let's create a dog.txt file, then input: git hash-object dog.txt 
        git returns our 40 hexadecimal hash, we didn't use -w yet so, 
        it will just display what it will end up as, but if we edit 
        the dogs.txt, like add two more dogs, git detects this, and the 
        hash changes, but lets store it now, so we'll run 
        the same command with -w: git hash-object dogs.txt -w, so now 
        this version of dogs.txt is store with our two extra dogs
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Now let's change the file again, add two more dogs, now there's 
        four dogs, and if we type git hash-object dogs.txt, we get a 
        new hash! Everytime we change our file, add things, alter things 
        in any way, the hash will change, but let's store this one too using 
        the -w flag, now we have two stored one dogs.txt file with two 
        dogs inside, and one dogs.txt file with four dogs inside
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        So let's use the git cat-file -p 39e27511, it will display our 
        first two dogs, then if we enter git cat-file -p fd9150c2, it 
        will display the four dogs in that version of dogs.txt, and 
        I should mention those shortened hashes we passed in above 
        after our '-p' flag, git recognizes the full hash based on 
        the first 8 or so digits, but if we wanted to be complete, 
        we could've copy/pasted the entire commit hash
    
    </h3>
    <h3>
        We can also insert versions of our dogs.txt file with the following 
        command, let's say we only have two dogs currently, we can insert 
        the other two dogs from the second version of our file 
        with this command: git cat-file -p fd9150c2 > dogs.txt, we 
        use the '>' plus the file name.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Remember we haven't committed anything, this data is stored in 
        things called 'blobs'
    </h3>
    <h2>
        Deep dive into Git Objects: BLOBS
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Git blobs, blob stands for 'Binary large object', are the 
        object the type Git uses to store the contents of files in a 
        given repository, blobs don't include the file names, they only 
          store the contents of a file
    </h3>
    <h3>
        So in our last example when we stored the dogs.txt versions, 
        those are blobs
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        Every hash from the previous exercise is a BLOB, this leads 
        us into our next section TREES
    </h3>
    <h2>
    Deep dive into Git Objects: TREES
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Trees are a git objects used to store the content of 
        a directory, each tree contains pointers that can refer to 
        blobs and other trees. Each entry in a tree contains the SHA-1 
        hash of a blob or tree, as well as the mode, type, and filename
    </h3>
    <h3>
        So BLOBS store the contents of a file, but TREES store the 
        content of a directory which include BLOBS and other TREES, 
        TREES contain pointers to other blobs and trees
    </h3>
    <h3>
        So we can have a TREE, this TREE has two BLOBS (our index.html, and 
        main.js files), and a TREE (Styles), that it points to, the Styles tree points 
        to two BLOBS (Body style body{}) and (navbar style navbar{})
        
    </h3>
    <h3>
        We're not going to create any new TREES right now but we can 
        view TREES with the command: git cat-file -p main^{tree}
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Remember, git cat-file -p prints the git objects, but if we add 
        the main^{tree} to the end, this will give us the most recent tree 
    
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
        $ git cat-file -p note-taking^{tree}
    100644 blob 2b4eb0287622d89edb9535d322422dba3d38d416    README.md
    100644 blob 1440d71259518f525f2299cf4cfda33c53af77ca    index.html
    100644 blob e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391    script.js
    100644 blob 01f2952e2ffe695935273e314b539670dd664c9a    style.css
    
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Also we can use the '-t' flag before the hash name like:
        git cat-file -t 01f2952e2ffe695935273e314b539670dd664c9a, 
        the output would be blob, '-t' tells us the type
    </h3>
    <h2>
        Deep dive into Git Objects: Commits
    </h2>
    
    <h3>
        So let's go over the underlying structure of commits, commit objects 
        combine a tree object along with information about the context that 
        led to the current tree, commits alone store a reference to a parent 
        commit(s), the author, the commiter, and the commit message 
        itself
    </h3>
    <h3>
        So when we run 'git commit', git creates this new commit object 
        for us, and it sets the parent to be the current HEAD commit, and 
        whose tree is the current content of the index. So there's an 
        actual index file, and when we run git commit, the commit tree will 
        reflect the contents of that index file
    </h3>
    <h3>
        So every commit contains a reference to a tree, if 
        we type the command: git cat-file -p commithash, so like 
        git cat-file -p 095aa11, then hit enter the following is 
        displayed:
    </h3>
    <h3>
        $ git cat-file -p 095aa11
    tree 76bc86554f0233b71c414bd40cb9dc37743a83a7

    added intro to git objects: commits
    
    </h3>
    <h3>
        And we can also verify the above's type if we type:
        git cat-file -t, the '-t' is short for type, so we're asking
