    <h2><u>Fetching and Pulling</u></h2>

    <h3>
      In this section we'll discuss git fetch and git pull, so if we're working
      with a collaborator. We've seen the other half with the git push command,
      but now we'll look at git pull
    </h3>
    <h3>Here's what's critical in this section:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Remote tracking branches</li>
      <li>Git Fetch</li>
      <li>Git Pull</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>A closer look at cloning</h2>

    <h3>
      When we clone a repo, whatever it is, what happens is that after we clone
      the repo to our local machine we receive all the commits, all the files
      from the repo, but we also receive the "remote tracking branch", which is
      a reference to the state of the master branch on the remote, we can't move
      this, it's like a bookmark pointing to the last known commit on the master
      branch on origin
    </h3>
    <h3>Remote tracking branches follow this pattern: remote/branchname</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        origin/master references the state of the master branch on the remote
        repo named origin
      </li>
      <li>
        upstream/logoRedesign references the state of the logoRedesign branch on
        the remote named upstream (a common remote name)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Checking out remote tracking branches</h2>
    <h3>
      So if on our main branch, let's make changes, add and commit them and now
      we have two commits locally on the main branch, and we see something new,
      theres a message in git bash that says: On branch main Your branch is
      ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit. (use "git push" to publish your local
      commits)
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So if we do this again, after adding another name to our animals.txt file,
      now we see: Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits. (use "git
      push" to publish your local commits) nothing to commit, working tree clean
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So that's the point of this, it shows how many commits are since the
      origin/main
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We can also checkout what our origin/main looks like, using git checkout
      origin/main, we'll end up in detached HEAD
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So let's type git branch -r to view the remote tracking branch, in our
      case it's origin/main
    </h3>
    <h3>
      After entering git checkout origin/main the following message is
      displayed: git checkout origin/main Note: switching to 'origin/main'. You
      are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
      changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
      state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch. If you
      want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so
      (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example: git switch -c
      new-branch-name Or undo this operation with: git switch - Turn off this
      advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false HEAD is now
      at 10e4639 Create pets.txt
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We can now create another branch from this state, remember now our changes
      to pets.txt are gone , and we're back to pets.txt original state
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We can now switch back to the main branch, and our pets.txt file changes
      return, now we see reagan, maggie, and buck
    </h3>

    <h3>
      So if we want those changes to go onto GitHub, we just push them with git
      push origin main,
    </h3>
    <h3>
      I'm having some problems pushing to GitHub, im changing my config from
      [core] repositoryformatversion = 0 filemode = false bare = false

    </h3>
    <h3>
      to the user email - lrsorrenti@hotmail.com, let's see if this works.... it
      didn't.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      Okay so half-hour and lot's of googling later I got to a stack overflow
      answer, to fix the above problem where is says user name of my old GitHub
      luso8 is denied. I don't understand exactly why it was letting me push
      yesterday and earlier today then suddenly stopped, but after going into
      windows credentials manager and deleting the luso8 credentials, git push
      now works, what's also confusing me is why is LRSORRENTI not showing up in
      that windows credentials page? Wait no I just checked, the credentials
      before were luso8, my old GitHub, now it says the credentials are set to
      LRSORRENTI, hopefully this is the last time I'll need to do this, maybe
      there was an easier way of bypassing the credentials problem through git,
      but hey it works now so let's get back to the course.
    </h2>

    <h2>NEXT SECTION: WORKING WITH REMOTE BRANCHES</h2>
    <h3>
      For ex, if we have a repo we want to clone, that has many different
      branches on GitHub, how do we work with those branches locally
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So colt has a remote-branches demo repo we're going to clone, after
      cloning we type git branch and we see only one branch, main, even though
      on GitHub we saw that this specific repo has 5 or 6 branches
    </h3>
    <h3>
      How do we work on the other branches then? Well we can view the remote
      branches with git branch -r command, we see all the branches we couldn't
      see with just git branch, so git knows about those branches, so that's why
      we need to discuss the diff between a full-fledged branch and a remote
      tracking branch
    </h3>
    <h3>
      By default, when we clone a repo from GitHub, we get the main/master
      branch, and automatically it's pointing to origin/master, but we have
      other branches in our case it's origin/movies, origin/food, origin/fantasy
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Let's say we want to work on a branch called puppies, what we could do is
      use checkout origin/puppies, but remember that puts us into detached HEAD
      state,
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Lets do git checkout origin/food, after entering it displays the "you are
      in deteched HEAD state", but now we can see the files inside of our food
      branch,
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Let's say I want access to these branches, we can use the git switch
      command + remote branch name to create a local branch of that remote
      branch so we can work on it
    </h3>
    <h3>
      And yes this does now work, when I type git branch main AND food now show
      up as accessible branches locally
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Now let's do the same for the remote movies branch, so from main type git
      branch -r to view all remote branches, we see movies is a remote branch,
      then type git switch movies, and voila we now have the remote movies
      branch local to our machine
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Note: git switch is clutch in this regard, in the past we would need to
      type git checkout --track origin/movies in order to achieve the same as
      git switch movies, so more concise
    </h3>

    <h2>Git Fetch THE BASICS:</h2>

    <h3>
      Let's talk about fetching and pulling, fetch and pull are two commands we
      can use to get changes down from GitHub, if you're working on a team, and
      someone makes/pushes changes, we use git fetch to pull those changes down
      from the remote repo (GitHub) and it fetches them to our local repo, just
      the local repo though, fetch does NOT bring the changes all the way to our
      current workspace, that's what git pull does.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The git pull command will bring changes down from our remote repository
      (GitHub) and bring them all the way down to our workspace.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So fetching allows us to download changes from GitHub, BUT those changes
      will not automatically integrate into our workspace, it let's you see what
      your teammates have been working on and the changes they've made, without
      having to merge those changes to your local repo
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Think of git fetch as "hey, please go get the latest info from GitHub, but
      don't integrate it into my working directory"
    </h3>

    <h3>
      The command itself is: git fetch origin, or git fetch remotenamehere If a
      remote is not specified after git fetch, it will automatically fetch
      origin
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We can also use git fetch origin master or git fetch origin branchName to
      fetch a specific branch
    </h3>

    <h3>
      A good way to think of it is, let's say your teammate Bob made 3 changes
      to the remote repo, we can use git fetch to bring those changes down and
      view them without directly altering our working directory, those changes
      will not automatically change our working directory, we can view them and
      see what Bob has done to the project
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So once we use git fetch origin master, in order to view those changes we
      pulled down from GitHub we use: git checkout origin/master
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Okay so the exercise went well, except when I added an apple.txt file on a
      different branch from master, then used git fetch, it wasn't showing up, I
      think it's because I didn't use git checkout, I used git switch
    </h3>
    <h3></h3>
    <h3>
      Okay so I tried again but this time used this answer from stack overflow,
      git checkout origin/yourbranchname -b newbranchname git log newbranchname
      You should see remote changes in the newbranchname. You can also merge
      those changes into your branch with git checkout yourbranchname git merge
      origin/yourbranchname
    </h3>
    <h3>
      After entering the above I was able to view the changes I made on a new
      branch.
    </h3>

    <h2>Git Pull</h2>
    <h3>
      git pull is another command we can use to retrieve changes, except with
      pull it will integrate those changes, and immediately update our working
      directory, think of it as a git fetch + git merge all ine one go. As
      opposed to git fetch where we can view the changes, but our working
      directory stays the same.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      The syntax is similar to fetch it's: git pull remote branchname so it
      would look like git pull origin master, so it would both fetch the data
      changes AND integrate in one command
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Keep in mind where we run git pull matters, whatever branch we're on,
      that's where the changes will be merged to
    </h3>

    <h3>
      Pulls can also result in merge conflicts, and we'll need to resolve them
      like a normal merge
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Okay so after using git pull, a message in git bash popped up asking for a
      commit message as to why the merge was necessary, so I googled it and came
      across this answer:
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Type the subject of your commit on the first line. Remember to keep it
      short (not more than 50 characters). Leave a blanagraphs and bullet points
      to give a detailed breakdown. Don't write everything out on one line,
      instead, wrap text at 72 characters. Press Esc and then type :wq to save
      and exit.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Then after entering esc and :wq the changes from GitHub, two ascii art
      files were fetched and merged into my working directory
    </h3>

    <h2>Git Pull Merge Conflicts</h2>

    <h3>
      Pulls can result in merge conflicts, sometimes we'll get a fast forward
      merge and things go smoothly, but if changes were made on GitHub, then we
      try to pull, a merge conflict may appear
    </h3>

    <h2>Shorter syntax for git pull</h2>
    <h3>
      Often when we use git pull, we can get away with a shorter syntax: git
      pull
    </h3>

    <h3>
      If we run git pull without specifying a particular remote/branch to pull
      from, git assumes the following:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Remote default to origin</li>
      <li>
        Branch will default to whatever tracking connection is configure for our
        current branch
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Note: This behavior can be configured and tracking connections can be
      changed manually. Most people don't mess with this stuff
    </h3>
