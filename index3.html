        <u>Installing Git, terminals vs GUI's </u>
      </h2>
      <h3 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
        We're going to start with the command line first then we'll use a GUI to
        see what that's like, the GUI we're going to utilize later is: GitKraken
      </h3>
      <h3 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
        GitKraken is free and it's the GUI that colt recommends

        <u>TERMINAL CRASH COURSE</u>
      </h2>
      <h3 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
        In this section I'm going to run through some of the essential terminal
        commands for navigation for moving around on your machine. We need this
        in order to work with Git. Commands like ls and pwd, and cd:
      </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <ul>
        <li>
          "start ." command - this command will open the file explorer of
          whatever directory you're inside of
        </li>

        <li>
          "ls" the ls command will display all files currently inside of the PWD
          or present working directory, we can also use ls with a folder name to
          display whats inside of a selected folder like "ls 'Pictures'" or "ls
          'Desktop'"
        </li>

        <li>
          Anyway, the next command I'll show you is pretty simple. It's called
          'pwd' for print working directory. And what this will do, it's very
          simple. It just prints out your current location. It prints out the
          path to where you currently are.
        </li>
        <li>
          So to our next command which is 'cd' (change directory) it's the
          equivalent of changing folders in file explorer. So to change
          directories we can go from something like /Desktop to
          /Desktop/GIT_AND_GitHub_COLT-STEELE by using the cd command followed
          by the directory name so the above would be: cd
          /GIT_AND_GitHub_COLT-STEELE
        </li>
        <li>
          Now let's look at how to move 1 directory backwards. So if we're stll
          inside /Desktop/GIT_AND_GitHub_COLT-STEELE, we would do 'cd ..' cd
          followed by two dots .., now we're back into just /Desktop
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-4">
      <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
        <u>Terminal Crash Course: Creating Files & Folders</u>
      </h2>
      <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
        To create a new file we use the 'touch' command followed by the name we
        want to assign to the file so for ex: //// touch index.html style.css
        script.js //// so after we run that command three files will be created
        inside of whichever directory we are in, an html, css, and javascript
        file
      </h2>
      <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
        Now lets look at how to create folders or directories, the command is:
        mkdir myDirectory // so we now created a directory called myDirectory
        and if we cd into it we can create more directories inside of it, or
        just create files, or both. mkdir is just a way to organize files. You
        can have directories inside of directories and even more directories
        inside those with files inside all of them. It's a good way to organize
        your files.

    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
        <u>Terminal Crash Course: Deleting Files and Folders</u>
      </h2>
      <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
        To delete a file we use the command 'rm' followed ny the name of the
        file. Remember this fully deletes the file it doesn't just send it to
        the recycling bin like using delete on the Desktop would, after using
        'rm' the file is fully gone, so be careful with this command.
      </h2>
      <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
        Now keep in mind we can't use the 'rm' command to delete directories,
        instead to delete full directories we must use 'rm -rf' command, so it's
        just rm with the -rf flag after followed by the directory name (rm -rf
        testDirectory), this would delete the testDirectory
      </h2>
      <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
        We can add flags to a lot of commands, one is ls -a, that command will
        display all files including hidden files, so -a modifies the behavior of
        ls
      </h2>

    <div class="container">
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center"><u>Git Repos</u></h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">What really matters in this next section</h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      We're going to go over what git repos are, and we'll learn 'git init',
      'git status' commands, we'll also go over the git folder and what's inside
      of it, the Committing workflow, an important concept to incorporate into
      your daily coding routine, we'll also discuss three more commands 'git
      add', 'git commit', 'git log', these are very important commands, so
      practicing them is crucial
    </h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center"><u>Repository</u></h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      A git 'repo' is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a
      folder, anytime we use Git with a project, app, etc we need to create a
      new git repo or Repository, we can have as many repos as we need, all with
      separate histories and contents
    </h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      So just because we have git installed doesn't mean we're automatically
      using it, we have to tell git we're creating a new Repository, it's a
      unique workplace with it's own history, each repo is like encapsulated
      bubbles.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      For example if we want a repo inside a specific folder or directory we
      must tell Git: Ok I want a repo inside this directory. And whatever
      commands I run are specific to that repo.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      Now that we know what repos are in general, let's go over how to intialize
      a new repo using git, but first let's go over the 'git status' command,
      and the 'git init' command
    </h2>
    <div class="container">
      <ul>
        <li>'Git Status' Command</li>
        <h3 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
          The 'Git status' command will give us info about the current repo, if
          there's a repo the command will return something like: "On branch
          gitdemo nothing to commit, working tree clean" if there isn't a repo
          in the specified location 'git status' will return an error
        </h3>
        <li>
          'Git init' Command
        </li>
        <h3 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
          So when we use 'Git init' whatever folder or directory we are inside
          will become the location of a new git Repository, keep in mind we only
          ever run 'git init' once per project, so if we had a project
          myWebsite, we use 'git init' at the beginning, and we could work on
          myWebsite project for years and years, we only use 'git init' once at
          the start of a git repo, we want that continued history.
        </h3>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h3 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
    Now there is a hidden file/folder that is created when we use git init, for
    example if we type 'ls -a' inside our current directory it shows the
    following: ./ , ../ , .git/ , index.html , style.css, script.js
    </h3>
    <h3 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      We can even cd into the .git folder and it will show things like: 'HEAD',
      'config', 'description', 'hooks', 'refs', 'info', 'objects', we can also
      delete the .git folder but beware, this deletes the repo entirely, rm -rf
      .git, the .git folder is where everything is stored, that's why it's a
      hidden folder, so you don't accidentally delete or mess with it.
    </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center"><u>Common early git mistakes</u></h2>
    <h3>
      So it's important to understand when we initialize a git repo, anything
      nested inside the directory that we intialize with 'git init' is tracked,
      so you could have folders inside of directories, inside of directories
      inside of more directories, all that is tracked if we use 'git init' in
      the parent directory, it tracks every file change all the way down.
    </h3>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      <em
        ><u
          >WARNING! DO NOT INIT A REPO INSIDE OF A REPO, BEFORE RUNNING GIT
          INIT, USE GIT STATUS TO VERIFY THAT YOU'RE NOT CURRENTLY INSIDE A REPO
        </u></em
      >
    </h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      We want to keep our repo's separate, because it can cause problems later
      on, avoid this. Just make sure to always use 'git status' to double check
    </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center"><u>The committing workflow overview</u></h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      What is committing? Committing is using checkpoints or like saves in a
      video game, you add a nav bar then commit, then change something, else and
      commit that change, on and on. Like in a game you can make a save early
      on, then revisit that early save after some time so see a previous version
      of your character. We can undo commits, revisit early commits, merge
      commits.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center"><u>Git add/commit command</u></h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      This is the first command we use when we want to make a commit, the
      workflow is usually like:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Work on stuff, make new files, edit or delete files</li>
        <li>
          Add the changes with 'git add', where we group specific changes
          together in preparation of committing, now the files we specify to add
          are now in the staging area
        </li>
        <li>
          Commit the changes with 'git commmit', Commit everything that we just
          added with 'git add', now the files that are in the staging area are
          commited, usually followed by a commmit message 'git commit -m
          "message here"', the message should summarize the changes made
          concisely
        </li>
      </ol>
    
    <h2 class="mb-4 mt-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      To reiterate when we commit we always include: git commit -m "message
      here" with a massage as descriptive and concise as possible
    </h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      Also to add multiple files to the staging area, you would use the command:
      git add .
    </h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      So (git add .) git add plus a dot at the end will stage all modified
      files, so if we changed index.html and style.css in in this repo then did
      git add . both files would be staged, but you could technically stage 10
      modified files or 50 or 100 using git add .
    </h2>
</div>
<div class="container"></div>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">Git committing exercise</h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      Okay so I just finished the git commit exercise and ran into a problem,
      there was an error being thrown when I was trying to use (git add
      groceries.txt and yard.txt) after googling the error I found the fix to
      the problem on stack overflow, to fix the error message:
    </h2>
    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g. an editor
      opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes are terminated then
      try again. If it still fails, a git process may have crashed in this
      repository earlier: remove the file manually to continue.
    </h2>

    <h2 class="mb-4 d-flex justify-content-center">
      We need to cd into our .git directory then use the command: (rm -f
      .git/index.lock) and this fixes the error message, hopefully this didn't
      do anything bad inside our .git directory but I suppose we'll find out
      later? The error did not occur in colt's demonstration so I'm not sure
      what I did specifically but after deletion it worked.
