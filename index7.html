      </ul>
    </h2>
    <h2>What does GitHub do for us?</h2>
    <h3>
      GitHub is a hosting platform for git repositories, you can add your repos
      to GitHub and access them on any computer anywhere, as well as share them.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      GitHub also provides additional collaboration features not native to git,
      but are very useful, in essence GitHub helps people share and collaborate
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Also gitbub is the home of open source projects, this is a good way of
      getting experience working on a project with others.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      GitHub can help show that you know how to work/collaborate on things, it
      can be a good way of showing to potential employers that you know how to
      collaborate well, and know how to help with projects
    </h3>
    <h2>Cloning</h2>
    <h3>
      We use git clone to go and get a repository that's not on your machine and
      brings it to your machine. Basically downloads the contents of a repo from
      a url
    </h3>
    <h3>The command itself is: git clone https://GitHub.com/blah</h3>
    <h3>
      Also keep in mind we can also clone a repo from any website that has a
      public repository, for ex on Gitlab there are some public repos to clone,
      instead of a GitHub url, it would be gitlab.com/randomrepo
    </h3>
    <h2>SSH Config</h2>
    <h3>
      SSH stands for Secure Shell, and an ssh key is used for authentication,
      for things like pushing to a repo from your local machine, your terminal
      will prompt you for your GitHub email/password every time unless you set
      up your SSH key
    </h3>
    <h2>Creating a repo</h2>
    <h3>If you have repo you'd like to push to GitHub, here are the steps:</h3>
    <h3>Option one:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new repo on GitHub</li>
      <li>Connect your local repo (add a remote)</li>
      <li>Push your changes to GitHub</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Option two if you've not done work on your local repo yet:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Create new repo on GitHub</li>
      <li>Clone it down to your machine</li>
      <li>Do some work locally</li>
      <li>Push changes back up to GitHub</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Remote</h2>
    <h3>
      The next thing we need to do is take an empty GitHub repo, and configure
      it so that it knows about our local repo, we do this with a remote, like a
      destination url, like a label, so we can fetch code
    </h3>
    <h3>
      To view any existing remotes you may have you can use the git remote or
      git remote -v (v stands for verbose, use for more info) if we haven't
      added any remotes, it will display nothing
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We use the command: git remote add name url, a standard name is git remote
      add origin https://GitHub.com/blah/repo.git
    </h3>

    <h3>
      We can also rename / remove our remotes with the following commands:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>git remote rename "name-here" "new-name-here"</li>
      <li>git remote remove "name-of-remote-to-remove"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intro to pushing</h2>
    <h3>
      Now that we have a remote set up let's push some stuff to GitHub, to do
      this we use the git push command
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We must specify the remote we want to push up to AND the specific local
      branch we want to push to the remote
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The command is: git push "remote-name" "branch name", for this repo it
      would be git push origin master
    </h3>

    <h2>
      The next few lines are direct copies of the transcript of colt's video
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Okay. So let's talk about how we actually get our code up on GitHub. How
      do we take a local git repo on our laptop? And how do I connect that in
      some way to a hosted GitHub repo? How do I connect them? How do I set up
      the repo on GitHub? And then what do I do on my machine to tell it about
      the GitHub repo? Well, there's really two different approaches or two
      options that I'm going to walk through in this video. I'm just going to
      talk about both of them and just explain how they work and then we'll dive
      into actually doing them.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So the first option called option one is if you have an existing repo on
      your machine, if you have something that you've already been working on,
      it already has git history, you already have code, whatever it is, and you
      want to get that on GitHub. These would be the steps that you follow. You
      create a new repo on GitHub, then you connect your local repo by adding
      something called a remote. We'll go into that. So you add that remote to
      your local machine and then you push your changes up to GitHub. So here's
      some diagrams.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      If I have something I've been working on, whether it's just a day of work,
      an hour of work, an empty repository that I've created or years of work,
      whatever it is, if it's on my machine and not on GitHub, I go on to GitHub
      and I make a new empty repository. I'll show that in just a moment to. So
      once I make that new empty repository, then what I do is tell my computer.
      Specifically tell this git repository about the GitHub repository. And
      then I can push my code up to the GitHub repo. The other option is if I
      don't have anything done yet, I don't have a repo anywhere. I know I want
      to start a project and I know right out of the gate that I also want to
      use GitHub alongside Git. If that's the case, I can start on GitHub, make
      a new repo on GitHub and clone that down to my machine as an empty
      repository.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Instead of running git init I can clone down my GitHub repo that's empty
      and start working in that repo and then push it up to GitHub. And if I do
      it that way, I don't have to manually connect my local repo to my GitHub
      repo because if I clone this repo from GitHub, it automatically is
      connected to that GitHub URL. So some diagrams to illustrate that. I don't
      have any repositories yet either on GitHub or on my machine. And I start
      by making a new repo on GitHub, which I'm visualizing is this empty
      container, and then I clone that down to my laptop. And because it came
      from this clone, it automatically knows about this GitHub URL. So now I
      can do my work locally and push it up. I don't have to connect them in any
      way, but I'm going to actually start by showing you the other option.
      Option one, because you may have some existing code. I mean, we certainly
      have existing repos from the course. None of them are very useful, but we
      have existing repos. Right.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      We've been working with Git and let's talk about how to get that on
      GitHub. So to do that, the first step is to make an empty GitHub repo. So
      if you want to follow along, start by just picking some git repository
      that we've made or that you've made that you want to get on GitHub. So it
      doesn't have to be something that you make public and it doesn't have to
      be something that you keep up there, right? You can delete it or get rid
      of it immediately if you don't want people to see it.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So we've done quite a few different repositories. Why don't I just take
      that really simple book repository? My first novel. All right. So it's a
      disastrous repo. I'd like to get all of this up on GitHub. All right. All
      this history, all my files. One more time. This is what I'm dealing with.
      So whatever you have found, if you have a repo you want to follow along
      with, the first step is to go on GitHub.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      So once you're signed in and create a new empty repo and there's a couple
      of buttons to do that, one is just this green button if you're on the home
      page new or if you're somewhere else like I'm on Marketplace. If I click
      the plus new repo right there, then I see this page create a new
      repository. So we need to come up with a name about GitHub, demo, novel or
      something like that. This is just a name that we'll use to identify it on
      GitHub, right? It doesn't have to match anything from our actual
      repository that we have locally, but we don't want spaces. It will
      automatically add dashes for us. I don't know, I just put them in there
      myself. But we don't need to do that.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      You don't really need a description, although you should put one in,
      especially if you plan on having other people see this repo or discover
      it. But we will talk more about that to keep this short and simple. I'm
      not going to put a description in there and then we can decide if it's
      public or private. Now, I'm going to keep this public in case some of you
      want to take a look at the repo, although, frankly, for the contents of
      this book, it's probably best for my reputation if I do make it private.
      That just means that if someone looks at my profile, if they search,
      they're not going to find this repository. They don't have access to it.
      But if it's public, anyone can see it. And then I'm not going to touch
      this.
      <h3>
        We will come back and talk more about these files later. I'm just going
        to click Create Repository. And did I click? I might have not. I guess I
        didn't click. And we now see this page here. So my username, Colt Slash
        and then the repository name, and then inside of it. There's not really
        anything to look at right now except for a couple of instructions. All
        right, so I'll stop here. We've made an empty GitHub repository. Our
        local repo knows nothing about it. They're not connected in any way, but
        that's going to change in the next video.
      </h3>
      <h2>GIT REMOTE SETUP</h2>
      <h3>
        All right. So the next thing that we need to do is take this empty
        GitHub repo that's in the cloud. It's not connected at all to our local
        repo and somehow configure our local repo so that it knows about this
        GitHub repo.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Well, the way that we do this, whether we're using GitHub or any other
        service that hosts the repo, is to set up a git remote. So a remote is
        really just a fancy name for like a destination URL. It's a URL that we
        tell get about and we give it a name. It's just like a label for a URL
        that we can then push code up to or fetch or pull down new code from.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        So we'll learn about those commands once we set up a remote. So an easy
        place to start is with this command git remote or get remote dash v.
        They won't do anything except list to you the current remotes that you
        have in a repository. So in our repository we have not configured any
        remotes. Right? At this point. We haven't done anything with remotes. If
        I type git remote or git remote V, I'm in my book, my first novel, The
        Great Gatsby repo nothing. But if we actually go to any of the repos
        that we cloned, if you follow a followed along, I cloned this 2048 repo
        from GitHub. Remember this one it has a whole bunch of commits it's that
        addicting 2048 game anyway if I type get remote in here I see something
        now origin we'll talk about that in a moment.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Let's do dash v so you can see the difference. If I do dash v, I think
        it's verbose. We see the name of of a remote and the corresponding URL.
        So I didn't set this up right. All I did was get clone and then this URL
        and by doing that get made me a local repo. It put all these files in
        here, it gave me all the history and it set up a remote that said the
        original GitHub URL that this repo came from, that it was cloned from IS
        right here. So by setting this URL up, this remote origin, it gives me
        the ability later on to say, Hey, Git, is there any new code on that
        URL? Is there any new updates? Or if I was a collaborator, hey git, I'd
        like to push up my new ten commits.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        It's kind of a lot to push up, but I'd like to push my new two commits
        that I did today up to Origin. So I'll just show you one more example.
        If I take a look at that see sample project that was the one that I
        cloned in the second video I did. It's really very simple. Nothing in
        it. It came from was it Bitbucket? I believe if I do get remote V No,
        git lab. Sorry, it was a non GitHub repository. The same thing is true.
        Right. I have a remote called origin automatically set up. I didn't do
        that and it set to whatever I cloned or whatever the URL is that I
        cloned it from. Okay. So we did not clone this repository, right? My
        first novel, we we ran getting it. We created it from scratch. So there
        are no remotes, but we can make a remote using this command, get remote
        add and then a name and a URL. So this is a way of telling git hello
        gets. Please remember this URL using this name. So whatever the name is
        that we provide. So a really standard name is origin.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        So get remote, add origin and then some GitHub URL for a GitHub repo
        that we've created is telling git. Hey, here's a URL, I'm going to call
        it origin. You remember that anytime I refer to origin, I'm talking
        about this URL. So the term origin, it's just a conventional git remote
        name, but it's not special in any way. No magical powers. It doesn't
        have any secret abilities. It's just a name for a URL you could rename
        them. You can come up with whatever names you want for remotes, but
        origin is what you'll see all the time, similar to how the master branch
        is a default name or the default name for branches, you can change it to
        anything. So in the same way that master is just a name for a branch
        origin. It's just a conventional name. You'll see it a lot, but it is
        not somehow special. It's just a name for a remote.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        So we could instead add a new remote for the same URL, but instead call
        it my GitHub URL or lol or chickens are my friends, whatever you want,
        but I would suggest origin because it's what you'll see the most and
        then a URL. And actually if we go to the GitHub repository that we
        created that's empty, we see some instructions. It's telling us, first
        of all, if you've done this thing before, this kind of thing before,
        here's a URL that is the URL for my repo. I hope this goes to that.
        Saying you should be using your URL, right?
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Not my repo because you won't have permission to push your code up to my
        repository. So I hope you made your own. If you're following along then
        it's telling me if you don't have a repo yet on the like at all locally,
        follow these instructions. But I do. So I'm not following those. This is
        what we want. Push an existing repo from the command line and take a
        look at the very first line. Get remote, add origin and then the URL for
        my git repo. It's the same URL we see here, so I'm going to copy that or
        just copy the whole line. It doesn't really matter. I guess I'll
        separate it out just to hit the point harder here. So I'm on the my
        first novel repository right now. No remotes now get remote add and then
        a name. I'm going to go with origin. It's conventional.

      And then this GitHub URL, whatever your GitHub URL is for that repo. Now
      nothing really happens. But of course we can check our work with what we
      just saw get remote v. So hopefully we see origin set up to this URL and
      it is. So that's kind of all we need to do for now. We've connected. We've
      told our local git repo about a GitHub URL called Origin or that's the
      name that will refer to it by.
      <h3>
        So in the next video, I'll show you how we can push code up to origin. I
        just want to emphasize one more time, it's just a name for a URL, a
        remote destination, and this is not super common, but if needed you can
        rename a remote with this command, get remote, rename the old name,
        space, new name and you can get rid of a remote with git remote remove
        and then the name that you're trying to delete. And later on we'll
        actually see that it's somewhat common to have multiple remotes,
        especially when you're working on open source projects. We'll talk about
        workflows and how that would work when we get to that section.

      <h2>Intro to Git Push</h2>
      <h3>
        So we have one more step to get our code up on GitHub. We just need to
        push it up. So if you remember option one, what we're following
        here.Option one out of two is to create a new repo on GitHub, which
        we've done. Connect the local repo by adding a remote to our GitHub
        repo. We just did that in the previous video. Now we need to push our
        changes up so we have our existing repo. I'm doing that stupid Great
        Gatsby novel fake repo. I created an empty GitHub repo and then I set my
        remote called Origin so that it points at this empty GitHub repo. So the
        final step is to push up. So we do this using the git push command.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Again, this is not GitHub specific though. Everything will be pushing to
        will be a GitHub repo, but the get push command is a git command that
        existed long before GitHub. And there are many other places where you
        can have a hosted repo that you can push to. So it works with any
        remote. Basically the syntax is git push and then a remote.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        In our case we just have one which is origin, but we can have multiple.
        So we have to tell git where we're pushing, what's the destination
        repository and what branch to push. So, you know, we might have a really
        large repo with a ton of branches. Like actually we don't have a ton
        here, but we've got a couple. No, just to. Oh, well, this is because
        this video or this repo was created before we went into branching. But
        some of our repos have like, I don't know, seven, eight, maybe ten
        branches and you may not want all of them on GitHub or you may not want
        to push them all at once at least. So when we push, we call out a
        particular branch that we want to send to GitHub. Often that will be
        your master or main branch, but you can push any branch up to GitHub and
        I'll show you that.
        <h3>
          So this is a really common command to get Push Origin Master, though
          it is becoming slightly less common as more people rename their master
          branch to Main. If you recall, we talked about this early on when I
          introduced branching. It now comes up again Master versus Main because
          GitHub, as I mentioned at the end of 2020, decided to make the default
          branch name on a GitHub repo main instead of master. So their
          instructions tell you to add a remote called Origin, but then rename
          your branch the master branch to Main and then push Main. So I will do
          this as well. In a separate video I will show this process. It's the
          exact same process. We rename a branch, we name it main, and then we
          push up Main. But I'm going to start with Master, just to keep this as
          simple as possible, because we have a master branch, right?
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We've been working with the term master, so we'll start there first.
          So I have this remote called origin as we already discussed, get
          remote dash v, we see what it's pointing to and it's always a good
          idea to see what what we have, if we have any uncommitted changes that
          won't go up otherwise we're ready. We're going to do a git push and
          then origin is where we're pushing to and then master is the branch we
          are pushing up. Okay, so this is what our GitHub looks like right now.
          I'll refresh. There's nothing here except these instructions. This is
          the repo. But now I'm going to push and there's going to be a
          substantial change. And remember.
        </h3>
        Oh, gosh, I put images in this repo, didn't I? Well, that's why it's
        taking a little bit. So you can see here I have some images in that mood
        board. Usually you don't include images in a or at least not large
        images like I have, but it finished up. Most repos are going to push
        way, way, way faster than that because they're usually just code. So I'm
        going to refresh the page. And now we see something entirely different.
        Right. We don't see those instructions. Now we see our file contents. So
        chapter one, chapter two, chapter three, characters outline. We see
        different commits. I'll actually do a separate video where I walk
        through what we see, but we also have access to things like
        contributors. We can see there's only one branch which is the master
        branch, and I can take a look at chapter one. For example, here's the
        contents of Chapter one.
      </h3>
      Okay. So we have our code up here. Now, what I want to show you is that we
      can push any branch. I talked about pushing master because that's what we
      have on this project. But if we make a new branch, which I'll just make,
      what should my branch be called? How about empty or nearly empty? I switch
      to that branch and I'm just going to delete pretty much everything in
      here. I'm going to delete Moodboard for sure. So that's actually our m
      dash ref to get rid of that. It's a folder. And erm. How about all
      chapters? Chapter one. I'll just leave the outline and the characters. So
      now, whoops, this is all we have. I'm on a branch, though, called Empty,
      so I'm going to add everything and then get, commit, delete most things.
      All righty.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Now, if I want to push the code that I just changed, I want to push my
      last commit from this branch. Remember, I'm on the empty branch. I need to
      push the empty branch. So let me illustrate that here. I've got some
      diagrams. What we just did was we pushed up our master branch to GitHub.
      So there was nothing on GitHub. I pushed up master. Whoops, I went to far
      get push origin master assuming our remote is named Origin. Now in this
      diagram, I have a second branch called New Feature. I'm going to push that
      up. Get Push Origin new feature. In our case, our branch is called empty.
      So get push origin empty. I don't have to be on this branch, by the way. I
      happened to be on it, which is very common that you're taking a look at
      what's on a branch and then you push it up, but you don't have to be on
      it. So get push origin empty. And remember, if it asks you for your
      password, not a big deal. It put your email and password or your username
      and password, but go back and check out the SSH video so that it doesn't
      have to keep bugging you, you know, asking you for a password every time
      you push.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Okay. So now I'm going to refresh. And it doesn't look like much changed.
      But now we have two branches and we can see the two branches here, master
      and empty, and I can switch between them. And this is my empty branch. I'm
      just viewing it on GitHub and you'll see it just has two files. Right? Go
      back to Master. And I have a whole bunch of stuff. So I'm going to just go
      through this process one more time, just to make it very clear, I'm going
      to go back to Master, get switch master and let's make some some changes.
      We'll do some new work here. How about chapter four? Dot txt. All righty.
      And I'll just leave it blank, I guess. And I'm going to add that. So get
      ADD Chapter four, get commit. Begin Chapter four.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Pop quiz. What's on my GitHub? What's the most recent comet that I'll see
      on the GitHub repo? Nothing has changed on GitHub. It's still exactly the
      same. If we're looking at the master branch, nothing's changed. If we're
      looking at the empty branch, nothing has changed since we last pushed.
      GitHub doesn't just stay in sync automatically with my local repo. I have
      to push. So why don't I push up that commit? Chapter four begin chapter
      four. Now I said push up that commit. We don't select a specific commit.
      We push an entire branch as we've talked about. So I made that commit on
      the master branch. So I'll push that up, get push origin. The only remote
      we have right now. Origin Master. Now, if we head over here and refresh,
      we see first of all, my most recent commit begin chapter four one minute
      ago. We also see the actual updated contents. Right. Chapter four text is
      right there. Okay. So in the next video, I'm going to kind of walk through
      a GitHub repository, show you how we view the commits, the branches, diffs
      or changes, all that stuff. And then we'll get some more practice with
      pushing and we'll talk about renaming to use the main branch.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      Okay so I made a branch off master called testgitpush, switched to that
      branch, then made a change, added/committed, git status to make sure tree
      is clear, then did git push origin testgitpush and GitHub updated, now it
      has a dropdown menu showing both master branch and my new testgitpush
      branch
    </h3>

    <h2>
      The next section is more practice with git push. It went well, I did more
      practice with adding/deleting files/content then pushing those changes to
      GitHub, and seeing GitHub update with those changes in real time.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      So colt just went over how we can push a local branch up to a different
      branch at the same time, example:
    </h3>
    <h3>git push remotename local-branch:remote-branch</h3>
    <h3>
      The exmaple colt uses is with a pancake branch thats local and a waffle
      branch that's remote, it's not very common but the point is that it's
      possible. git push origin pancake:waffle
    </h3>
    <h3>Another example</h3>
    <h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          git switch -c "cats" (this creates and switches to a new branch called
          cats)
        </li>
        <li>touch cats.txt</li>
        <li>git add cats.txt</li>
        <li>git commit -m "create cats file"</li>
        <li>
          git push cats:master (this tells git to take the cats branch
          containing a txt file and push it to our master branch on GitHub)
        </li>
      </ol>
      So we just pushed the cats branch to the master branch, this is a good
      example that shows the difference between the branch on your local machine
      and the branch one GitHub.
    </h3>
    <h2>Intro to the "-u" flag appended to the git push command</h2>
    <h3>
      "u" stands for upstream, normally we want the upstrean branch to be origin
      master/main, running git push -u origin master sets the upstream of the
      local master branch so that it tracks the master branch on the origin
      repo.
    </h3>

    <h2>Another workflow: Cloning first</h2>
    <h3>If you haven't yet began work on your local repo you can:</h3>
    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a brand new repo on GitHub</li>
        <li>Clone it down to your local machine</li>
        <li>Do some work locally</li>
        <li>Then push back to GitHub</li>
      </ul>
      Okay so this seems pretty easy, just create an empty repo, copy the
      hash/cloning address, use the command: git clone
      https://GitHub.com/Colt/chickens-demo.git Then a message pops up saying
      "you appear to have cloned an empty repo", type git status and it should
      say on branch main/master, and if we use the git remote -v command it
      shows we're all set up and ready to start making changes, we can now git
      add/commit/push and GitHub will be good to update.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Also just a note, going forward we should use main instead of master for
      our big branch, we can rename a branch with this command: git branch -M
      main
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Keep in mind we have to change the default branch in GitHub settings,
      after I used the git branch -M main, it didn't rename it, created a branch
      from master called main. To fully change the name there is a way:
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Renaming Git Branch Follow the steps below to rename a Local and Remote
      Git Branch: Start by switching to the local branch which you want to
      rename: git checkout old_name Copy Rename the local branch by typing: git
      branch -m new_name Copy At this point, you have renamed the local branch.
      If you've already pushed the old_name branch to the remote repository ,
      perform the next steps to rename the remote branch. Push the new_name
      local branch and reset the upstream branch: git push origin -u new_name
      Copy Delete the old_name remote branch: git push origin --delete old_name
      Copy That's it. You have successfully renamed the local and remote Git
      branch
    </h3>
    <h3>
      I'm going to leave master and main up on this project as an example.
    </h3>

    <h2>
      GitHub basics exercise: last section on intro to GitHub, going to do
      colt's end of section exercise now
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Okay so the exercise went well, up until the merge conflict, there was a
      merge conflict that I resolved in VSCODE but when I pushed it back to
      GitHub it showed the >>>> head >>> and the unstaged changes in the
      push/change, I should've double checked before pushing. Exercise is now
      done though, pretty comfortable with git push now.
